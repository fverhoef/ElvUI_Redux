# ElvUI Redux
ElvUI: Redux is a plugin for ElvUI that adds several features:
* Custom styling for pretty much every ElvUI element that has a backdrop, with:
  *  Shadows for each element, configurable in color and size.
  *  Textured borders, the styles for which can be set globally, or overridden per element type.
    *  A number of border style textures are included with the addon, mostly based on existing Masque addons (Masque is **not** required for ElvUI: Redux!).
* Layout customization for several screens and elements:
  * Minimap Button Frame integrated into ElvUI's minimap, for gathering all minimap addon buttons in one place.
  * TBC only: Retail-style Character screen.
  * TBC only: Larger profession/trainer/quest log screens.

All customizations can be toggled on and off via the ElvUI options GUI.
Additionally, the plugin also includes an installer for my personal profile.
