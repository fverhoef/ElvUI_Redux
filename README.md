# ElvUI Redux
ElvUI: Redux is a plugin for ElvUI that adds several features:
* Automation, much like Leatrix_Plus but configurable via ElvUI.
* Custom skins for pretty much every ElvUI element that has a backdrop, with:
  *  Shadows for each element, configurable in color and size.
  *  Textured borders, the styles for which can be set globally, or overridden per element type.
    *  A number of border style textures are included with the addon, mostly based on existing Masque addons (Masque is **not** required for ElvUI: Redux!).
* Layout customization for several screens:
  * Retail-style Character screens.
  * Larger profession/trainer/quest log screens.
* An Inventory Database, allowing tooltips to display item counts across all your characters.
* Minimap Button Frame integrated into ElvUI's minimap, for gathering all minimap addon buttons in one place.
* A few tooltip customizations.

All customizations can be toggled on and off via the ElvUI options GUI.
Additionally, the plugin also includes an installer for my personal profile.

Dependencies: ElvUI

Note: Currently only actively developed for ElvUI TBC version; a retail version may follow later.
