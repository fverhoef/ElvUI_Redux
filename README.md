# ElvUI Redux
ElvUI: Redux is a plugin for ElvUI that adds several custom skins for pretty much every ElvUI element that has a backdrop, with:
*  Shadows for each element, configurable in color and size.
*  Textured borders, the styles for which can be set globally, or overridden per element type.
  *  A number of border style textures are included with the addon, mostly based on existing Masque addons (Masque is **not** required for ElvUI: Redux!).
* Layout customization for several screens:
  * Retail-style Character screens.
  * Larger profession/trainer/quest log screens.
* A few tooltip customizations.

All customizations can be toggled on and off via the ElvUI options GUI.
Additionally, the plugin also includes an installer for my personal profile.

Dependencies: ElvUI

Note: Currently only actively developed for ElvUI TBC version; a retail version may follow later.
