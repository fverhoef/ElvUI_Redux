# ElvUI Redux
ElvUI: Redux is a plugin for ElvUI that adds several features:
* Automation, much like Leatrix_Plus but configurable via ElvUI.
* Configurable shadows for pretty much every ElvUI element.
* Configurable borders for pretty much every ElvUI element.
  *  Border styles can be set globally, or overridden per element type.
  *  A number of border style textures are included with the addon, mostly based on existing Masque addons (Masque is **not** required for ElvUI: Redux!).
* Layout customization for the Character/Profession/Trainer/Quest Log screens.
* A few tooltip customizations.
* An Inventory Database, allowing tooltips to display item counts across all your characters.

All customizations can be toggled on and off via the ElvUI options GUI.
Additionally, the plugin also includes an installer for my personal profile.

Dependencies: ElvUI

Note: Currently only actively developed for ElvUI TBC version; a retail version may follow later.
